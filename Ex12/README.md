# Exercise 12: If, Else-If, Else
## How to Break It
### Remove the else at the end and it won't catch the edge case.
### Change the && to a || so you get an "or" instead of "and" test and see how that works.
## Extra Credit
### You were briefly introduced to &&, which does an "and" comparison, so go research online the different "boolean operators".
### Write a few more test cases for this program to see what you can come up with.
### Go back to Exercises 10 and 11, and use if-statements to make the loops exit early. You'll need the break statement to do that. Go read about it.
### Is the first test really saying the right thing? To you the "first argument" isn't the same first argument a user entered. Fix it.
